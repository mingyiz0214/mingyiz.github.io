Dr. Mingyi Zhang is an Assistant Professor in the School of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. He earned his Ph.D. and M.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (2017–2022) under the supervision of Dr. Gregory S. Rohrer and Dr. Paul A. Salvador, and his B.S. in Chemistry from Renmin University of China (2013–2017). Before joining OU, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (2022–2025) supervised by Dr. James J. De Yoreo.

Dr. Zhang’s research focuses on interfacial phenomena and the use of advanced microscopy techniques to investigate materials behavior. His current work explores photochemical and electrochemical processes, materials behavior under extreme conditions, and the design of bioinspired hybrid materials for mechanical and energy-related applications.
